Things that are handled already:
-Parsing
-Commands // figure out which one is already made

Things to do:
-Continue the main loop (request PASS from user, NICK and USER)
-Get information from the connecting client and use it


int setsockopt(int sock, int level, int option_name, const void* option_value, socklen_t option_len)
-set SO_SNDBUF to set send buffer size
-set SO_SNDLOWAT for minimum number of bytes to process (set to 1 for at least 1 char)
-returns -1 upon error, 0 otherwise

//TODO: set up receiving client information with the client class. 
getaddrinfo needs to get the hostname from resolving the ip address of the client
get IP address from the accept() call 
(char ip[INET_ADDRSTRLEN]; 
inet_ntop(AF_INET, &(client_addr.sin_addr), ip, INET_ADDRSTRLEN))
