Notes for Auré

Things that are handled already:
-Parsing
-Commands // figure out which one is already made (none)


Things to do:
-Continue the main loop (request PASS from user, NICK and USER)
-Parsing before commands;
-CMD PASS NICK and USER;
-JOIN and INVITE command

Auré:
-Handle channel-related stuff:
1. Handle operators of channels
2. JOIN and INVITE command

Will:
-Parsing avant les commandes (Nous dire ce que tu vas nous envoyer)
"The PASS command is not required for the connection to be registered, 
but if included it MUST precede the latter of the NICK and USER commands." -https://modern.ircdocs.horse/
-Signaux (gérer CTRL-Z avec nc, voir correction sur slack pour détails)

Alex:
- PASS NICK USER command for now
